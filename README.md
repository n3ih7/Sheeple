# Sheeple

Sheeple is a tool for converting Shell scripts into Perl scripts.

Generally compilers take a high level language as input and output assembler,which can then can be directly executed. Such a translation is useful because programmers sometimes convert shell scripts to Perl even that it performs only a partial translation of shell to Perl.
*You can copy `test_suite/test_output.sh` to each subfolder, then execute it to test the expected results.*
